# Parsing sindbad.ru

# first _actual_ computer bug was found by a woman, Grace Hopper:
# http://ids.si.edu/ids/dynamic?id=NMAH-92-13130&container.fullpage

# catch the bug in file num 100 (!)


#### RESULT:

#  It's not a BUG, it's an undocumented FEATURE! 
#  RAW data may contain the SAME flight TWICE! 

#  I don't know why. One needs to find such an example live on sindbad.
#  So the replacement comp_name>0 ====> comp_name=1 seems OK

# flights_xxx.csv, companies_xxx.csv, price_xxx.csv
